# QuestionTime
This project is a Quora clone built with Django REST Framework, Bootstrap v4 and Vue.js and allows the authentication and registration of new accounts and a full CRUD system for questions/answers. 

All of these functionalities have been implemented as a REST APIs (login/registration process are a pure Django services instead) and they are fully reachable by the frontend, developed using Vue.js (v.2) and coupled with Bootstrap v4 (only for the .css part).

I have also used npm and VUE-CLI (with its user interface) for the first setup of the frontend project and, of course, webpack bundle tracker (v. 0.4.3) for the creation of bundle.js/bundle.css for the production build.
